# JoesDemo

I was tasked with building a SwiftUI app that could access data from a web API
This simple app uses a shared URL session to import JSON data and decddes it into a viewed list. 
It's not entirely complex but it demonstrated the ability to import data from the web into an app
and store it in the proper location.

Added a few features for smoother viewing and navigation.
